#### Package Requirements
	1. MySQL
	2. flask
	3. flask-cors
	4. pymysql

We performed most of our experiments with the basic interface 
	--> (folder - Interface1Basic)

#### Running the interface requires mysql 
#### ==== without any password set ======
#### If you decide to set the password, update it in the newserver.py file 

#### We haven't been able to host this as a service yet
#### If absolutely required we can host it on heroku, 
#### but it was just too much pain to get things working, :P

	1. Make a sql database with name annotationdbname
	   and update it with the data in annnotationdbname.sql

	2. Once such a database exists, run the file newserver.py 
	   in the terminal/commandprompt

	3. Open the index.html file in a browser and start annotating
